  s.description      = <<-DESC
    A Swift micro-framework for generating compact identifiers that are time ordered without the need for synchronization. Unlike UUID-based methods, the identifiers would only be 63-bits long â€” hence fit as a positive number in a 64-bit integer. These identifiers are also roughly time-ordered, hence can be used as a sorting attribute to get the corresponding data objects sorted by time as well.
    Inspired from Twitter Snowflake identifier-creation algorithm.
